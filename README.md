## Overview

This project involves the visualization and exploration of the PhonePe Pulse data. PhonePe Pulse provides insights into the digital payment transactions in India. The goal of this project is to create interactive and insightful visualizations using Streamlit and Plotly to analyze trends and patterns in the data.

## Usage

1. **Run the Streamlit app:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. **Open your browser and navigate to:**

    ```
    http://localhost:8501
    ```
    
## Features

- Interactive data visualizations using Streamlit and Plotly
- Insights into transaction volume, value, and user demographics
- Customizable themes for the Streamlit app
- Easy to use interface for exploring PhonePe Pulse data
